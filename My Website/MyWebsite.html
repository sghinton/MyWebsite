		Welcome to Randy's webpage!  Here we have a short bio, and although it's 
		entertaining, we hope you check out the other areas of this site too!
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			Randy Hinton is an author, musician, and co-web designer.  He also
			belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and plans
			to serve a mission when he turns eighteen.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			Randy Hinton was born around the turn of the century, and began his mortal
			life among a family soon to boast seven children.  He grew up being homeschooled,
			and loved every minute of it...  well maybe not EVERY moment.  Part of that
			schooling involved piano.  He went from teacher to teacher, beginning with
			his dad.  When his father no longer had the time to teach him consistantly, he
			began moving from teacher to teacher.  This wasn't due to being a bad student, but
			was more often because he'd progress faster than the teachers had seen and allowed.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			At one point, his family moved to Erda, Utah, and it was there when he discovered a love
			for writing.  It started out as more of a hobby, but soon became an obsession, and
			by the age of fifteen, he'd written an entire ninety thousand word book.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			"I'd never considered the idea of publishing my book when I started writing it, but when
			I finished writing, there was no way I COULDN'T publish it."  As he learned about publishing,
			he began making up random hymn arrangments.  They weren't ever written down, but were like
			his book-a hobby.  Then a few key events changed his look on both his book AND his
			arrangments.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			"When the pandemic hit, it didn't affect me in the same way it affected many others.  I
			suffered from the lack of social interaction like everyone else, but I also discovered
			the time to write both my book and work on my arrangments."  Randy recalls, "I still
			got to see my friend Hudson Halling occasionally, and that often gave me the social
			opportunities I often lacked.  He played piano too, and we would spend hours at a time
			others in our musical endeavors.  I accomplished quite a bit on my book too, but the first
			playing on various instruments, talking about things we were learning, and supporting each
			year of Covid was mostly a musical advancement."
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			During Covid, Randy thought his education would be impaired, due to the deterioration of
			many of his in-person classes.  However, he quickly began learning other things-things he'd
			never had learned in normal school.  Among these are how to find query agents, the best
			strategies to earning scholarships, how to gain permissions from other agencies to
			arrange and use their pieces/songs.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			Randy Hinton is now residing in a small town in Utah, and is mapping out what he wants to
			do for the next ten years of his life.  As mentioned earlier, Randy is going to serve a full-time
			mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, possibly leaving before he
			finishes his second book of the series-therefore leaving his readers in an extremely intense
			cliff-hanger.
