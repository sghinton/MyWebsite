			Randy has published few books, but is writing many.  
			The current titles you will see in the market are
			Destiny Calls, and soon, The Second Island.  He
			will shortly begin the commencement of a new series,
			which won't be available to the public until at least
			2024.
		</p>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			In Destiny Calls, the main characters are 
			Todd and Keyanne, the other most important characters 
			being Courtney, Hannah, Ben, Corra, Catherine, and 
			Emma to name a few.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			The first book of the series is about Todd and Keyanne 
			aiding the escape of the Shrinking and Growing Animals 
			from the first Kauru Kaumatra island.  Todd is the 
			son of Courtney and David Bradford, who are both 
			in the beginning scenes of the book.  Keyanne is the 
			daughter of Shannon and Tom Seraneph.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			Todd grew up around Corra, the main Shrinking and Growing Animal 
			of the book, but was soon introduced to others, namely Catherine, 
			Ruby, and Onyxis.  The escape of the island is planned while the 
			invasion of the island is commencing by King Callidus, the 
			Antagonist.
		</p>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			In The Second Island, a new main character is introduced.  Her 
			name is Grace, and she has the unique ability to control heat.  
			Shortly after the beginning of this book, she is taken with Todd 
			and Keyanne back to the second island, where they engage in the 
			dangerous conflict between the natives of the island, and the 
			Shrinking and Growing Animals.
		</p>
		<p class="mainInfo">
			In this second book, Todd is going through the process of becoming 
			an adult, and is faced the problem of saving the entire race of 
			Shrinking and Growing Animals--and choosing between Grace and Keyanne.
